<br>This repository contains the source code and trained model for a small-scale pretrained dialogue response generation model. The dataset was taken from the American sci-fi comedy animated series Rick and Morty.
<br>The repository contains the launch code (colab), dataset, and a link to the pre-trained model.

# How to work with this
The neural network knows 3 characters: Rick, Morty and Someperson.
<br>Example: RICK What do you want to know? Morty
<br>The dialogue phrase will be "What do you want to know?", the character who says it: Rick. The responding character is Morty.
